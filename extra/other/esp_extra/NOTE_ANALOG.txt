NOTE: Calling analogRead() too frequently causes WiFi to stop working. When WiFi is under operation, analogRead() result may be cached for at least 5ms between effective calls.

ESP8266 has a single ADC channel available to users. It may be used either to read voltage at ADC pin, or to read module supply voltage (VCC).

To read external voltage applied to ADC pin, use analogRead(A0). Input voltage range of bare ESP8266 is 0 â€” 1.0V, however some boards may implement voltage dividers. To be on the safe side, <1.0V can be tested. If e.g. 0.5V delivers values around ~512, then maximum voltage is very likely to be 1.0V and 3.3V may harm the ESP8266. However values around ~150 indicates that the maximum voltage is likely to be 3.3V.

To read VCC voltage, use ESP.getVcc() and ADC pin must be kept unconnected. Additionally, the following line has to be added to the sketch:
ADC_MODE(ADC_VCC);
